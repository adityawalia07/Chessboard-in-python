# Chessboard Visualization with Custom Function

This project generates a visual representation of a chessboard pattern overlaid with a custom mathematical function using Python's Matplotlib and NumPy libraries. The result is a colorful and dynamic plot that showcases how mathematical expressions can be visualized alongside classic patterns.

## Features

- Generates an 8x8 chessboard pattern using modular arithmetic.
- Implements a custom mathematical function that combines polynomial terms and exponential decay.
- Displays the chessboard and the function with transparency for a layered visual effect.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation

To run this code, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
