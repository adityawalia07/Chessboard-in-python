# Chessboard Visualization with Custom Function

This project generates a visual representation of a chessboard pattern overlaid with a custom mathematical function using Python's Matplotlib and NumPy libraries. The result is a colorful and dynamic plot that showcases how mathematical expressions can be visualized alongside classic patterns.

## Features

- Generates an 8x8 chessboard pattern using modular arithmetic.
- Implements a custom mathematical function that combines polynomial terms and exponential decay.
- Displays the chessboard and the function with transparency for a layered visual effect.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation

To run this code, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```
## Imports:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Imports the Matplotlib library for plotting.<br>
import numpy as np: Imports NumPy for numerical operations.<br>

## Grid Definition:
dx, dy = 0.015, 0.05: Sets the resolution of the grid along the x and y axes.<br>
x = np.arange(-4.0, 4.0, dx): Creates an array of x values from -4 to 4 with a step of dx.<br>
y = np.arange(-4.0, 4.0, dy): Creates an array of y values from -4 to 4 with a step of dy.<br>
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y): Generates a 2D grid of x and y values for plotting.

## Chessboard Pattern:
z1 = np.add.outer(range(8), range(8)) % 2: Creates an 8x8 chessboard pattern using modular arithmetic. The pattern alternates between 0s and 1s.<br>
plt.imshow(z1, cmap="binary_r", interpolation="nearest", extent=extent, alpha=1): Displays the chessboard pattern with a binary colormap, ensuring it covers the specified extent.<br>

## Custom Function:
def chess(x, y):: Defines a custom function that takes x and y coordinates and returns a mathematical expression that combines polynomial terms and a Gaussian decay.<br>
z2 = chess(X, Y): Evaluates the custom function over the grid defined by X and Y.

## Overlaying the Function:
plt.imshow(z2, alpha=0.7, interpolation="bilinear", extent=extent): Overlays the output of the custom function on the chessboard pattern with some transparency.

## Title and Display:
plt.title("Chess Board with Python"): Sets the title of the plot.<br>
plt.show(): Renders the final plot.
